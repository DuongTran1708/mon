Looking at People (LAP) is a challenging area of research that **deals with the
problem of recognizing people in images, their posture, performing
action/gesture recognition** from still images or image sequences, also
considering multi-modal data, among others. Any scenario where the visual or
multi-modal analysis of people takes place is of interest within the field of
Looking at People. Several subareas of LAP have been recently defined, such as
Affective Computing, Social Signal Processing, Human Behavior Analysis,
Personality Computing or Social Robotics. The effort involved in this area of
research will be compensated by its potential applications for good: intelligent
assistive interfaces, TV production and home entertainment (multimedia content
analysis), education purposes, sociology research, security, prevention/early
diagnosis and rehabilitation/intervention of physical and/or mental diseases,
artificial assistant and coaching for active aging, etc.
