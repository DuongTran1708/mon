## Framework Structure

`üêà mon` is designed to keep everything within the framework, including data,
libraries, scripts, and more. It works optimally with an IDE like 
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/), but can also be easily used in any 
console environment.

## Core API

`üêà mon`'s core API includes several packages built on top of 
[Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

| Package                                         | Description                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| __[foundation](explanation/mon/foundation.md)__ | Base functionality for other packages |
| __[coreml](explanation/mon/coreml.md)__         | Machine learning code                 |
| __[createml](explanation/mon/createml.md)__     | Training code                         |
| __[vision](explanation/mon/vision.md)__         | Computer vision code                  |

## Optional API

`üêà mon`'s functionality can be extended by incorporating third-party code to
__[lib](explanation/lib.md)__ package. In addition, projects which are built on 
top of __[mon](explanation/mon/index.md)__ can be placed inside 
__[app](explanation/optional/app.md)__ package for better management.

| Package                                 | Description         |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| __[app](explanation/optional/app.md)__  | Application code    |
| __[lib](explanation/optional/lib.md)__  | Third-party library |
