## Framework Structure

`üêà mon` is designed to keep everything within the framework, including data,
libraries, scripts, and more. It works optimally with an IDE like 
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/), but can also be easily used in any 
console environment.

## [Core API](../explanation/mon/index.md)

`üêà mon`'s core API includes several packages built on top of 
[Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

| Package                                                  | Description                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| __[foundation](../explanation/mon/foundation/index.md)__ | Base functionality for other packages |
| __[coreml](../explanation/mon/coreml/index.md)__         | Machine learning code                 |
| __[createml](../explanation/mon/createml/index.md)__     | Training code                         |
| __[vision](../explanation/mon/vision/index.md)__         | Computer vision code                  |

## [Optional API](../explanation/optional/index.md)

`üêà mon`'s functionality can be extended by incorporating third-party code to
__[lib](../explanation/lib/index.md)__ package. In addition, projects, which 
are built on top of __[mon](../explanation/mon/index.md)__, can be placed inside 
__[app](../explanation/app/index.md)__ package for better management.

| Package                                  | Description                             |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| __[app](../explanation/app/index.md)__   | Code for specific applications/projects |
| __[lib](../explanation/lib/index.md)__   | Third-party libraries                   |
