Images captured in low-light and uneven brightness conditions have low dynamic
range with high noise levels. These qualities can lead to degradation of the
overall performance of computer vision algorithms that process such images.

**Low-Light Enhancement (LLE)** is a pre-processing step for computer vision
applications. This algorithm improves the visibility of the underlying
features in an image.
